The evening kicks off with a modest, 10-item consent agenda. Of note, [CA-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6509126&GUID=99DD9915-A0C1-4A85-AD6D-454D6B2D47D0&Options=&Search=), $800k for gas-powered golf cart leases. [CA-6](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6509124&GUID=63E4F9A7-D2F9-477D-BFD1-EFF2F235C076&Options=&Search=) is $140,000 for a grant for the Pauline-Runnymede Path. And the E. Medical Center Drive returns in [CA-8](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6509125&GUID=55F89262-A18E-4527-802C-B08A334A3312&Options=&Search=).

There is one public hearing on the agenda tonight. [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6476016&GUID=CB2F4676-CB8B-4E82-A17D-86C4C6F4457E&Options=&Search=) is for an ordinance second reading for changes to the rules on Conflicting Land Use Buffers.

There is one ordinance first reading. [C-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6516922&GUID=DABF7458-A183-4F5A-A102-E77B6E06DF00&Options=&Search=&FullText=1) is on changes to the early leasing ordinance that prevents landlords from making renewal offers to current tenants earlier than 180 days from the start of the current lease; clarifies and adds to the list of required information that landlords must include in a written renewal offer, including a requirement that the landlord list all changes in the terms and conditions from the current lease; merges two sections into one to reduce duplicate and conflicting provisions; and modifies all deadlines and timing to be counted from the start of the lease instead of counted from the end of the lease for clarity.

For resolutions, [DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6516295&GUID=2E43A248-B6F5-4AC5-B90C-F0D4281B3CB2&Options=&Search=) is for approving an agreement for legal services for help with acquisition of easements. [DC-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6516858&GUID=5BCC9E66-F4A8-454F-A81E-69C87EC0D770&Options=&Search=) is in support of strengthening the city of Ann Arbor's Fair Chance Hiring Practices. Finally [DS-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6516942&GUID=D3588E0B-1336-4FCE-91AF-85113EBB9852&Options=&Search=) is for publication of the ordinance changes from PH-1/B-1.
