Here's the [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1141275&GUID=98D6185A-D2FF-4471-A990-3DAFACBD5496&Options=info|&Search=).

There was a long, 34-item Consent Agenda at this meeting. Mayor Taylor recused himself from [CA-30](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6702376&GUID=E759F056-13F7-4678-9AAC-FE147E6D3FF3&Options=&Search=), an agreement with the Sam Bernstein Law Firm to pursue insulin pricing litigation, due to a conflict of interest. [CA-9](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6702495&GUID=3D3CACBD-3295-476D-9A9A-6FC3EB058FAE&Options=&Search=) was an agreement for an exclusive negotiating period for 4M to develop the long-blighted site at 415 W. Washington. CMs Eyer and Radina voted no, preferring a more traditional RFC process for the site. [CA-13](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6702366&GUID=C7B98D61-5B4A-48C1-9C5A-61A79C3C1791&Options=&Search=) was the renewal for the Spin scooter/e-bike contract. It was amended to shorten the term to 3mo instead of 1y with the city having an option to extend each quarter up to the original term.

[PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6647545&GUID=700F5EF6-6B74-4F90-B9B3-C1A2DFB373E2&Options=&Search=) and [PH-3/DS-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6704249&GUID=D1709469-2773-4542-AE4C-5C6666A327D9&Options=&Search=) were the zoning and site plan for the Five Corners PUD near the intersection of State and Packard. It was amended to add justifications for the land use, most likely due to the objections of the property owners next door, which currently houses a Domino's Pizza. A lawyer for that landlord was the only speaker opposed to this housing development, while two others spoke in favor.

[PH-2/B-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6697899&GUID=62E205BC-41A4-4648-ACFD-42A9E522A0A3&Options=&Search=) were changes to the snow removal ordinance, increasing fines for failure to remove snow from sidewalks adjacent to commercial and multifamily properties.

[DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6692444&GUID=2F90CE93-6173-4E19-8714-4F80BD9B7E23&Options=&Search=) was an appointment to add Erica Liu to the Independent Community Police Oversight Commission.

[DC-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6702390&GUID=83054470-124E-4955-979E-6D43B7D99F38&Options=&Search=) was a resolution in support of increasing State funding for public transit.

[DC-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6709371&GUID=E676B8CB-C628-4A20-8BFE-D87B022E3C30&Options=&Search=) was a resolution that hopes to ensure that facial recognition technology is used responsibly and equitably by the Ann Arbor Police Department.

[DC-4](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6709653&GUID=A9D1541E-67AF-4767-BB3A-FD1736F77743&Options=&Search=) was a Resolution Authorizing Application and Implementation of Michigan Shared Streets and Spaces Grant.
