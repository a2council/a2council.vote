Today's [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914286&GUID=13964FF7-84B4-44F6-8E93-E9345A4253F1&Options=info|&Search=) is short. Council members Disch, Song, Akmon, and Cornell were absent. Since there weren't sufficient votes remaining for items that require 8 votes, those items were moved to the first meeting in January. A few items of note:

* The [legislative policy document](http://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=11523045&GUID=A0BFED24-8EBA-4449-A40A-E6A6130E3AE7), which is City Council's request for action in Lansing, has been updated. Items in here have a much better chance of becoming law after January, when the Democrats have a trifecta in Lansing for the first time in 40 years.
* The [police contract](http://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=11511928&GUID=6AB7196D-1BF2-4808-9853-6B42AFF46A8A) contains incremental improvements for oversight, as requested by the Independent Community Police Oversight Commission. The chair of the commission spoke at public comment, and CM Harrison spoke at the Council table on this item.
* The East Medical Center bridge project has a new [memo](http://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=11526076&GUID=28140F86-6E60-4E84-A9F5-7A72C90FA9E4) which was not voted on, but was the topic of choice of three public commenters. The expansion plans for the bridge don't allow for additional width dedicated to pedestrians and cyclists, and this memo indicates there may be issues with the pedestrian underpass that was seen as a compromise. The actual construction contract is to be voted on at the first meeting in January.
