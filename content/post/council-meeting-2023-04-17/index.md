Here's the [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062171&GUID=CA414ADD-66B8-48BE-9373-6DCAFA7EECC3&Options=info%7C&Search=).

Even before we get to the consent agenda, there is a report that may be of interest. [AC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6167729&GUID=11070037-B403-412C-924A-25A28D3DB13D&Options=&Search=) is the response to resolution R-22-362. This is a report from the Administrator on the viability of food trucks at the Library Lot.

On to the consent agenda. [CA-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122680&GUID=8CA6F98C-22B0-43D8-8B82-7FC8B84476D3&Options=&Search=), [CA-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122679&GUID=4941E38C-154C-48AD-BBC5-182D9408260D&Options=&Search=), and [CA-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122690&GUID=DA669741-01A6-48AC-A7DB-4C138AE3CF2A&Options=&Search=) are street closures for Top of the Park, Sonic Lunch, and the ALLIANCE Opening Ceremony Dinner, respectively. There is also [CA-14](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6124799&GUID=9D65CC3D-0D29-4EC8-84E5-085A0325CB33&Options=&Search=), a resolution with Interface Studios for services related to rewriting Ann Arbor's Comprehensive Plan. 

There is one public hearing on the agenda this evening. [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6054963&GUID=41B151CE-10DE-4380-811B-79A5ADFADB3E&Options=&Search=) is on the second reading of the PUD for 415 W. Washington. This is currently a blighted city-owned property that is contaminated with pollution. This development would clean up that pollution and add a section to the treeline trail. This is a pre-entitlement PUD, meaning that the city is specifying what it wants to see here. A developer has not yet been contracted to build the project.

There are two ordinance first readings at tonight's meeting. [C-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122673&GUID=A5D97CFF-B226-417A-9440-D6301D5F0E39&Options=&Search=) and [C-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6122674&GUID=B86C7EFD-570D-4D6A-9631-9B1C10880908&Options=&Search=). Water rates are increasing slightly, in order to cover the costs of upgrades to our water treatment plant.

Finally we get to [DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6123551&GUID=1740B255-1846-4515-B92C-FF5C488C0513&Options=&Search=), an amendment to Council Rules. This change will allow them to postpone agenda items to a specific date.
