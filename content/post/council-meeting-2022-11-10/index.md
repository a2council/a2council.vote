Today's [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914283&GUID=FDDA6717-4EF1-4953-A0C9-8F19C77B2D4A&Options=info|&Search=) is fairly long.

* There is a [substitute resolution](https://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=11442199&GUID=54A81B48-F282-4EED-BB33-CD9B9CCEF38D) for [CA-3](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5898937&GUID=6A2588A9-AFBC-4D2B-8F8D-BEB7A66B0FFA&Options=&Search=) in an attempt to fix some issues identified with the South 7th reconstruction.
* There is a public hearing and vote on [TC-1 for the W. Stadium corridor](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5848468&GUID=2C93A7BD-8254-47C4-B6DA-8F34B104B038&Options=&Search=)
* There are proposed [rule changes](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5900759&GUID=3CD03E59-E8DD-4E23-8236-6F27C20B610F&Options=&Search=) to public comment which should allow more comment at the beginning of meetings, and not require people to call in first thing in the morning to get on the agenda. It also eliminates the ability to speak at council if you haven't signed up in advance.
