Here's the [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062179&GUID=72A10A68-6E3E-4A2D-9C1B-15FF554DC60F&Options=&Search=).

The evening kicks off with a 13-item consent agenda. Street closures are back at the top of the consent agenda, after two meetings at the end. CA-1 through CA-4 are all street closures. [CA-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6320669&GUID=FA682CA7-F3F5-420C-A437-C52C11395104&Options=&Search=) is Festifall. [CA-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6312388&GUID=E20195B5-893C-417B-B959-5463F60E04B4&Options=&Search=) is for the Eli Lilly Mobile Research Unit. [CA-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6312374&GUID=C583691F-6315-42E9-9072-6A268B22385C&Options=&Search=) is for the UM Show Your Love A2 Party. [CA-4](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6312387&GUID=BDCAB069-4733-4B6D-B8AC-27973F751C67&Options=&Search=)is for the Neutral Zone's 25th Anniversary.

Perhaps more interestingly, [CA-9](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6279103&GUID=4486E780-AEC1-44F1-ACA2-38933844EB7D&Options=&Search=) is the sale of the Y Lot (350 S 5th) to the Ann Arbor Housing Development Corporation. This will be used to build a large building that includes a substantial portion of subsidized housing. Some people have questioned why the city is not just giving the property away to the Ann Arbor Housing Commission. The reason for that has to do with the bonds that the city took for the property sale. In order to protect the tax-exempt status of these bonds, the city has to sell the property at fair market value. You can read more in the [administrator's report to council](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6321970&GUID=BCA09D81-7CE8-4333-B0EC-9EFDCECC4B35&Options=&Search=).

There are three public hearings on the docket this evening. [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6279098&GUID=0F2FE49F-914D-4806-89EC-5E12B9814D03&Options=&Search=) is for a batch of routine township island annexations. [PH-2/B-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6299453&GUID=5C6AE6E1-45C1-4344-B5F4-554AF6FDB16B&Options=&Search=) is the second reading of the ordinance adding the Home Energy Rating Disclosure requirement to the city's building code. [PH-3/DB-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6313491&GUID=2F7AF33E-7FAD-400C-AA94-F8F29C922270&Options=&Search=) is on the Brownfield plan for 303 N Fifth, and 312, & 314 Detroit Street.

Specifically it adds some new rules for Cannabis microbusinesses among other things.
