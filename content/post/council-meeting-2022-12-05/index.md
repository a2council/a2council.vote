Today's [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914285&GUID=C4934EEC-9F4C-49F9-8F96-FC565743EC41&Options=&Search=) is short. A few items of note:

* [CA-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5946066&GUID=1C62CBAE-695B-4B90-843C-62F424368452&Options=&Search=) is progress towards connecting Barton Nature Area and Bandemer Park.
* [DC-3](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5950249&GUID=61057FAC-4331-4972-BD45-DBCC2039EC73&Options=&Search=) is council committee appointments for this term.
* [DC-5](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5950251&GUID=8012EC81-7710-4533-ACBF-2420591260FD&Options=&Search=) is some tweaks to TC-1 to increase setbacks a bit and allow certain automotive uses, such as car rentals (zipcar, traditional rentals).
* [DC-6](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5953546&GUID=E614F3B6-5532-4665-A669-4999EF1392E8&Options=&Search=) is a motion to bring back a previous resolution looking into taking over State trunklines: Washtenaw, Huron, Jackson, and N. Main. The state would pay the city to take them over, and the city would receive more revenue share for maintenance. This agenda item is a budget allocation for a feasibility study.
