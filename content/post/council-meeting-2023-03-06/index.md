Here's the [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062167&GUID=E0772E97-A597-4D8B-B24E-C24ACE3A7CBB&Options=info|&Search=) for tonight's meeting.

The meeting kicks off with a modest, 12-item consent agenda. We've got street closures for the Burns Park Run (CA-1) and for restaurants and retail (CA-2). The city is also going to purchase a bike lane sweeper (CA-9)!

There are three pubic hearings on the docket this evening. All of them have to do with the Village of Ann Arbor development on the city's northside. [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6005255&GUID=7531C6E2-3442-4270-B34A-2F3E834CF3CF&Options=&Search=) is the rezoning, [PH-2/DB-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6035853&GUID=57F722C7-26DD-431C-8EA8-398C91F130ED&Options=&Search=) is the site plan, and [PH-3/DB-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6035866&GUID=C9928A56-731A-4BE6-BBD0-C19CBFF591BD&Options=&Search=) is the brownfield plan. This is a pretty big rezoning (~68 acres) of a former township island to R4A.

There are three ordinance first readings on the agenda as well. [C-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6035854&GUID=69B88891-67D1-4117-BC62-2636F177A5E0&Options=&Search=) is on revisions to the solid waste code. [C-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6035859&GUID=39B047F9-86E1-4368-AA20-411DDA2260DF&Options=&Search=) is on rezoning 3.13 acres of a township island on North Maple to PUD. [C-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6035825&GUID=70C23C18-EC57-4208-9A2C-DAE296372A9F&Options=&Search=) is on changes to the city's risk fund rules.

Moving on, there are 5 more resolutions on the agenda. [DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6024677&GUID=F15CA243-75B6-4F53-8DA9-B285F038CED8&Options=&Search=) appoints Brooks Curits to the Environmental Commission. [DC-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6020555&GUID=D3830602-6DBB-40DB-87FB-4D7553CA73B9&Options=&Search=) is the postponed street closure for the Monroe Street Fair.[ DC-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6048763&GUID=7FA8AF8B-0C7C-47C3-AB79-54ACE3D287F0&Options=&Search=) amends the agreement with Recycle Ann Arbor for multifamily pickup. [DC-4 ](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6048802&GUID=B0678B9E-FB71-40BE-B844-3540F69A1DA2&Options=&Search=)is a reallocation of extra money from the Human Services Fund. [DC-5](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6050905&GUID=5FF645A0-6E56-43C4-AF2E-4F136F69CE1F&Options=&Search=) is a resolution asking the Administrator to engage with the legislature about energy infrastructure reliability.
