The police and fire departments are opposed to this because the the event would coincide with the University's spring football game.

Neither elicited resident input.

On to the resolutions. [DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6012078&GUID=830F4CF9-870C-42F7-BFAF-02816E933419&Options=&Search=) is a resolution to appoint non-resident electors to city boards and commissions. [DC-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5968442&GUID=DB23C102-1FBB-4BF4-8E5D-2DC77407BD93&Options=&Search=) is the contract for the East Medical Center Drive Bridge. [DC-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6031367&GUID=643ED5F4-16B3-4DBE-884A-8BA185385FB0&Options=&Search=) is a resolution to support common sense gun safety laws at the state level.
