Here's the [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062178&GUID=B8648D38-14BD-483C-AB0A-8A1C5F526088&Options=&Search=).

The evening kicks off with a 21-item consent agenda. This meeting continues the new tradition of placing street closures at the end of the agenda, with [CA-21](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6300202&GUID=9AFB3BAE-38E1-49CD-9799-1CD0C3DFF11E&Options=&Search=), a street closure for the Go Blue Mix, Sept. 2. 

There is one public hearing on the docket this evening. [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062178&GUID=B8648D38-14BD-483C-AB0A-8A1C5F526088&Options=&Search=) is on changes to Transportation Commission. Specifically, it's a resolution that changes the rule that only seat on the commission be reserved for someone who owns a transportation business. This seat has been extremely difficult to fill and has been vacant since Jim of HEH chose not to be reappointed.

There are three ordinance first readings on the agenda tonight. [C-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6300534&GUID=2982C7CD-AC79-48A8-A9B4-A7717A933139&Options=&Search=) is the first reading for the South Town rezoning. This is a mass timber project encompassing the entire block bounded by State, Henry, White, and Stimson. It will replace several old houses with an environmentally friendly midrise.

[C-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6300535&GUID=63B41C04-F68A-4B18-9E57-0F1FEB13B1DF&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of an ordinance that makes some minor changes to TC-1 Zoning. [C-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6299453&GUID=5C6AE6E1-45C1-4344-B5F4-554AF6FDB16B&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of an ordinance to add a chapter on home energy rating disclosure (HERD).

Closing out the agenda, we have the resolutions. [DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6283152&GUID=627E42B4-7CC8-4FA4-83F0-23BDC3ADA56B&Options=&Search=) is a resolution to appoint Julius Buzzard to the Greenbelt Advisory Commission. [DC-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6293099&GUID=97A6AFE7-12C4-4A84-AF9F-758A4761F249&Options=&Search=) is a resolution to approve Kerrytown Concert Houses request for a liquor license. [DC-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6307921&GUID=02BFC213-4A59-4D82-AF6C-9E2D98D9246A&Options=&Search=) is a resolution to study Ann Arbor's response during severe weather emergencies. [DB-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6301129&GUID=24192C8C-4EFA-4311-A055-7BCB28A29F4C&Options=&Search=) is new bylaws for transportation commission.
