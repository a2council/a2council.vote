Today's [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914280&GUID=E3F1A9E6-2268-425E-96A6-808834333F90&Options=info|&Search=) has several items of interest, including two public hearings about a PUD on Depot St., a couple of consent agenda items, Right to Renew, and No Turn on Red downtown:

* [CA-6](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5815887&GUID=1E62874F-DACF-44DD-9E35-90D0D42D4EBA&Options=&Search=) is to approve removing a few parking spots in order to extend the S. Division cycle track all the way to Hoover.
* [CA-8](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5815888&GUID=38C1CA4F-CBA6-4218-A5E9-B61041F23021&Options=&Search=) is funding for a study to transfer state trunklines (N. Main, Washtenaw, Jackson Rd.) to city jurisdiction. This would allow us to manage those roads ourselves, so we could make them conform with city policy with respect to pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, among other things.
* [C-1](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5780260&GUID=3AD4E464-CB82-43BD-B2B4-09AFC37FA7CE&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of the [Right to Renew](https://www.aart.vote/our-campaigns#R2R) ordinance, postponed from the [September 6]({{< ref "council-meeting-2022-09-06" >}}) meeting.
* [DC-4](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5843846&GUID=C889F4E6-C68B-401E-9329-309479288FE4&Options=&Search=) would restrict turns on red downtown, in the area bounded by Kingsley, State, Hoover, and First.

* The [340 Depot St. PUD](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5815827&GUID=68BC9C49-4268-4158-8CFB-36754F81EAB3&Options=&Search=) has 4 agenda items attached to it: a rezoning public hearing (PH-1) and the corresponding rezoning item itself (B-1). Then there's the PUD plans themselves, which also have a public hearing (PH-2) and the actual council vote on the site plan (DB-1). You may speak at _both_ the rezoning and the site plan public hearings if you so choose.
