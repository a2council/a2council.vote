Today's [agenda](http://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=914280&GUID=E3F1A9E6-2268-425E-96A6-808834333F90&Options=info|&Search=) has several items of interest:

* [CA-6](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5815887&GUID=1E62874F-DACF-44DD-9E35-90D0D42D4EBA&Options=&Search=) is to approve removing a few parking spots in order to extend the S. Division cycle track all the way to Hoover.
* [CA-8](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5815888&GUID=38C1CA4F-CBA6-4218-A5E9-B61041F23021&Options=&Search=) is funding for a study to transfer state trunklines (N. Main, Washtenaw, Jackson Rd.) to city jurisdiction. This would allow us to manage those roads ourselves, so we could make them conform with city policy with respect to pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, among other things.
* [C-1](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5780260&GUID=3AD4E464-CB82-43BD-B2B4-09AFC37FA7CE&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of the [Right to Renew](https://www.aart.vote/our-campaigns#R2R) ordinance, postponed from the [September 6]({{< ref "council-meeting-2022-09-06" >}}) meeting.
* [DC-4](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5843846&GUID=C889F4E6-C68B-401E-9329-309479288FE4&Options=&Search=) would restrict turns on red downtown, in the area bounded by Kingsley, State, Hoover, and First.
