Today's [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062163&GUID=AA124C23-D091-485F-8CB8-8FFE002E373E&Options=info%7c&Search=) is longer than more recent meetings. There are four public hearings at this meeting. PH-2 and PH-3 are simple annexations, but there are two more meaty hearings:

* [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5959752&GUID=8C007B3E-933E-4D43-8F5B-AF9B6354DC39&Options=&Search=) is about amendments to tweak the best value contracting rules in areas such as timeliness, safety, workforce development, and exempting projects under $50k.
* [PH-4/DB-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5968451&GUID=01CEFB5D-AC8C-46C4-82D9-CF817564DC78&Options=&Search=) is council approval of the Parks and Recreation Open Space Plan.
* [C-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5968446&GUID=5185643A-F6C0-4FF9-9E50-B5B0ADE17156&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of a PUD at 530 N Division. This will allow a 4-unit building to be built on that site.
* [C-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5968447&GUID=008274CF-4EAE-4030-A5F4-4511821B8716&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of an ordinance amending storm water management rules.
