There are two nominations, nineteen items on the Consent Agenda, one ordinance at its first reading for a new PUD zoning, two public hearing for an ordinances at their second reading, and one resolution that's not otherwise described above. One person resigned from the AAATA Board.

Of particular interest:

* [CA-4](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5747326&GUID=C05BC862-E997-45BC-8E6A-DCACECB5E7A8&Options=&Search=) is a contract to redesign the city's website.
* [CA-12](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5747340&GUID=AFE5667A-F0BD-4827-937C-95D34BF3D2C0&Options=&Search=) is a contract to eliminate the sidewalk gap on Ellsworth between Stone School and State.
* [CA-13](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5747309&GUID=2F328A3B-D64B-49A4-A7A7-9D058FED69A3&Options=&Search=) is an agreement with the State to redo Scio Church from Seventh to Maple, which is in poor condition.
* [CA-15](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5747327&GUID=9ADBC3B0-33AF-445C-858B-4A251DF6055F&Options=&Search=) is a contract to do a bunch of Vision Zero quick-build projects to improve road safety. The list of projects is quite long, and there is a [PDF](http://a2gov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=11107015&GUID=D1C5AC49-D230-476F-99EE-749586055A42) that shows where they are overlaid on aerial photos.
* [PH-1/B-1](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5718603&GUID=52530060-ED89-45BF-AD81-FAECBF0801D3&Options=&Search=) are the public hearing and ordinance change second reading that would simplify some regulation of marijuana businesses and (separately) make some changes to how street trees are planted to make it more likely for them to survive. First reading was at the [July 18 meeting]({{< ref "council-meeting-2022-07-18" >}}), where it passed council unanimously (Eyer absent).
* [PH-2/B-2](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5718604&GUID=997A327F-999A-439E-AF3B-29591C3FB77C&Options=&Search=) are the public hearing and ordinance change that would eliminate parking minimums in the city. First reading was at the [July 18 meeting]({{< ref "council-meeting-2022-07-18" >}}), where it passed council unanimously (Eyer absent). From the text of the ordinance change:
  > Eliminating parking minimums is anticipated to result in a reduction of under-utilized impervious surfaces, land to be used more efficiently, incentivizing the construction of more residential units including more affordable housing units, and supporting transit.
* [DC-4](http://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5756105&GUID=1168FD0C-1155-4A11-A6E2-307F7E2D2164&Options=&Search=) is a recommendation to council to discuss a Right to Renew ordinance that would make it so renters must be offered a good-faith renewal opportunity before a landlord rents the space to someone else. This is not yet a full introduction of the ordinance change.
