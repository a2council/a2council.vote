Here's the [agenda](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062186&GUID=E4F826E3-059E-4EBB-B09E-BBF7D4E4FBA8&Options=&Search=).

The evening kicks off with a 7-item consent agenda. Of note, [CA-5](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6430466&GUID=4943203F-DFEE-43CC-BD7A-3B6E873ADDA8&Options=&Search=) is accepting a $182,360 to make the Bryant Community Center carbon neutral.

There are 5 public hearings on the docket this evening. [PH-1/B-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6393397&GUID=0A7A0C42-23B7-498D-8958-497684B6C938&Options=&Search=) is the second reading of a change to the Lockwood PUD that would allow a 4-foot modification to their setbacks due to an error.

[PH-2/B-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6393398&GUID=EECA0B9F-3593-4CD4-B080-55614B761C83&Options=&Search=) is the second reading of a fix to the downtown premiums for the D1 and D2 zones implemented in 2019. Current premiums resulted in no net affordable units being built, and removing them simplifies downtown zoning to use only height restrictions instead of both height and FAR.

[PH-3/B-3](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6393399&GUID=0A64E817-8471-4AC5-A8C3-68FA299DEFB0&Options=&Search=) is the second reading of changes to the setback rules for TC-1 that would measure setbacks from the curb instead of the property line. This wasn't unanimously recommended by Planning Commission, but the idea is to create a more consistent setback line along corridors, such as Stadium, that have irregular property lines.

[PH-4/B-4](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6393400&GUID=8E2B562A-B0F8-4F01-90E1-28BFF2BC4104&Options=&Search=) and [PH-5/DB-5](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6430463&GUID=3FC3EF98-B859-407E-8A6F-09ED399EBDB9&Options=&Search=) are the rezoning and site plan for the Briarwood Parking lot. The parking lot is being rezoned from Parking to C2B (Business Service District). The current plan is to raze the current Sears store and build a grocery store and sporting goods store. The parking lot will be redeveloped as three residential buildings with 352 total units.

There is one ordinance first reading tonight. [C-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/MeetingDetail.aspx?ID=1062186&GUID=E4F826E3-059E-4EBB-B09E-BBF7D4E4FBA8&Options=&Search=) is the first reading of the ordinance to ban most gas leaf blowers for environmental and noise reasons.

On to the resolutions. [DC-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6434097&GUID=16D195F1-0E42-4016-975D-A1F002EE45DA&Options=&Search=) is to approve the 2024 Council Committee Appointments. [DC-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6440495&GUID=851E1827-40D7-44D1-98F9-8A22FF7F32C4&Options=&Search=) is a resolution to launch engagement initiatives to support all electric leaf maintenance. [DS-1](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6430456&GUID=1F119E6D-DE31-41EA-90FB-8ADD4845C20C&Options=&Search=)and [DS-2](https://a2gov.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6430457&GUID=BEF36A2E-5E19-439C-8421-FB46004814BE&Options=&Search=) are resolutions to publish the changes to the downtown and transit corridor zones.
